### Description

Officially Kokoro's Downloader is a professional game downloader powered by CSocketMaster 1.2 that lets you choose from a periodically updated list of games, where you can see the game information and a preview image before downloading. But it's much more than that. Here is the list of what you can learn from this project: how to get free unlimited web space with unlimited bandwidth to share whatever you want, how to skin your form and at the same time keep an icon on the taskbar button and the system menu (not found anywhere else), how to download (and upload) files, how to work with transparent forms, splash windows, personal buttons, label links, proxies, update systems, windows registry, tabstrips, imagelist, personal tooltips, help files, winsock APIs, how to deal with microsoft listview bugs and more. You can upload your own files and share them with the world, NO FILE SIZE LIMIT. All the content shared on KD is legal, and I don't take any responsibility for what kind of material you share. Credits: Leo Barsukov, button control, Kaustubh Zoal, tooltip class, ArthurW, translucent code. This is my third and last post on VB, so I thought I could leave sharing one of my best codes. Keep the good work.
